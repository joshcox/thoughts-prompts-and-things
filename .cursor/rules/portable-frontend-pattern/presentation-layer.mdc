# Presentation Layer Rules

## Context-Free Components

**Rule**: Presentation components must be **context-free**:
- No direct data fetching.
- No direct access to global state, router, or service clients.

---

## Injection via Props

**Rule**: Any non-local state, data, or side effects must be **injected via props** (data in, callbacks out).

---

## Local State Scope

**Rule**: Keep local state strictly **UI-local** (e.g., open/closed, input text), not domain/business state.

---

## UI Widget Mindset

**Rule**: Treat Presentation components as **UI widgets** that can be dropped into any app that satisfies prerequisites.
