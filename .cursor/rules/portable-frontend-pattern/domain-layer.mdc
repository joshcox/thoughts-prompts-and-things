# Domain Layer Rules

## Business Logic Ownership

**Rule**: All **business logic, workflows, and app state** live in the domain layer (hooks, containers, feature modules).

---

## Data Communication

**Rule**: Domain talks to Data via a clear **frontend API** and passes **plain data + handlers** down to Presentation.

---

## Presentation Independence

**Rule**: Domain must not rely on Presentation internals; it should only know the public props API.

---

## Orchestration Layer

**Rule**: The Domain is the layer that "glues" the Data and Presentation together to create a cohesive application.
