description: Rules for building the data layer that abstracts data access and APIs
applies_to:
  - data layer
  - API clients
  - data fetching
  - network calls

# Data Layer Rules

## Network Isolation

**Rule**: All network calls and persistence logic live in Data (no fetch/axios in Domain/Presentation).

---

## Swappable API

**Rule**: The Data API should be **swap-able** (real vs mock vs alternate backend) without changing Domain/Presentation.

---

## Domain-Shaped Data

**Rule**: Data functions return **domain-shaped data**, not raw transport objects (no leaking transport concerns).

---

## Well-Defined Interface

**Rule**: The data layer has a well-defined interface that can be substituted so long as the contract is fulfilled.
