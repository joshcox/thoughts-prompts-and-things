* This is an obsidian vault.
* Use standard markdown link notation.
* Utilize frontmatter to configure tags
* Utilize frontmatter to provide helpful metadata
* Utilize README (index) pages at regular levels to index children


## Note Classification System

All notes should include frontmatter fields to classify their status, priority, and type:

```yaml
---
status: draft
priority: medium
type: note
---
```

### Status (Progress/Completeness)

- `seed` - Initial idea, fragment, or quick capture
- `draft` - Rough notes, incomplete thoughts, work in progress
- `developing` - Actively being expanded and refined
- `review` - Complete enough for review but may need refinement
- `complete` - Finished and ready for reference
- `archived` - No longer actively maintained but kept for historical reference

### Priority (Importance)

- `low` - Nice to have, exploratory, background material
- `medium` - Useful but not urgent
- `high` - Important for current work or decisions
- `critical` - Essential reference, decision documentation, or key patterns

### Type (Content Category)

- `note` - General notes, thoughts, observations
- `pattern` - Reusable patterns, architectural approaches
- `strategy` - Strategic thinking, decision frameworks
- `reference` - Documentation, guides, how-tos
- `draft` - Early-stage work, experiments
- `decision` - Documented decisions and rationale

### Examples

```yaml
---
status: developing
priority: high
type: pattern
tags: [architecture, frontend]
---
```

```yaml
---
status: seed
priority: low
type: note
tags: [exploration]
---
```

```yaml
---
status: complete
priority: critical
type: decision
tags: [architecture, orpc]
---
```

## README Index Pattern

README files serve as index pages that organize and navigate documentation within directories. They should follow a consistent structure:

### Structure

```markdown
---
status: draft
priority: medium
type: reference
tags: [topic, index]
---

# Section Title

## Overview

Brief description of what this directory contains.

## Documentation Index

### [`filename.md`](./filename.md)
**Document Title**

Description of what the document covers and when to read it.

**Start here if:** Guidance on when this document is most useful.

---

### [`subdirectory/`](./subdirectory/)
**Subdirectory Name**

Description of what the subdirectory contains.

**Key topics:** List of main topics covered

---

## Quick Navigation

- [Link Text](./path/) - Brief description
- [Another Link](./path/) - Brief description

## Key Concepts

- **Concept Name**: Brief explanation
- **Another Concept**: Brief explanation
```

### Guidelines

- **Type**: Always use `type: reference` for README index files
- **Tags**: Include `index` tag plus relevant topic tags
- **Priority**: Typically `medium` unless the index is critical for navigation
- **Status**: Use appropriate status based on completeness
- **Links**: Use relative markdown links with descriptive text
- **Sections**: Include Overview, Documentation Index, Quick Navigation, and Key Concepts where applicable

### When to Create README Files

- At the top level of major documentation sections
- For directories with 3+ related documents
- When navigation would benefit from an index
- For pattern libraries or collections of related content
